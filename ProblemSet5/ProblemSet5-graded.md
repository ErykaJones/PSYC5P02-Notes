* Explanation and documentation: 50%

## Problem 1 --- Creating and Modifying Vectors

* :memo: You used `mean` as a variable name which is already an existing function in Matlab! Be careful with your variable naming conventions! Be sure to have your code as clean as possible!
* :memo: Try to be even clearer about what you're printing to the terminal!

:memo: **Code: 1/2, Documentation: 1.5/2, Q1 total: 2.5/4**

## Problem 2 --- Matrix Manipulation

* :memo: Again, because `mean` was defined as a variable earlier, it caused issues on l. 34 when you tried to call the `mean` function.  Make sure your code can run without instructions!

:memo: **Code: 2/3, Documentation: 3/3, Q2 total: 5/6**

## Problem 3 --- If-Statements

* :memo: Code doesn't doe as instructed. You're evaluating the entire row which will return `false` unless all elements return true. 

:memo: **Code: 1.5/3, Documentation: 3/3, Q3 total: 4.5/6**


## Problem 4 --- While Loops

* :memo: Function definition in-line is causing issues running and is redundant with the stand-alone function. 
* :memo: I would have liked more reflection on what exactly you were having trouble with that you needed AI help with. 

:memo: **Code: 3/4, Documentation: 3/4, Q3 total: 6/8**



## Problem 5 --- Structures


* :memo: You didn't complete several sections of the problem
