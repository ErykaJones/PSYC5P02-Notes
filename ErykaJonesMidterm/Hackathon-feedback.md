**Q1:**
* Good! Try to be clear what you're printing to the terminal. 
* **code**: 3/3, **documentation** 2.5/3

**Q2:**
* Good start. Your issue was you were appending to the same variable that you were using to loop, so you kept making your list longer and longer and it was looping indefinitely. 
* **code**: 2/5, **documentation** 5/5

**Q3:**
* Good start. 
* **code**: 2/5, **documentation** 3/5

**Q4:**

* **code**: 0/5, **documentation** 0/5

**Q5**
* Great work. 
* **code**: 0/5, **documentation** 0/5

**Q6**
* Good job. Clock isn't maybe timed perfectly to the onset of the text though. Also not sure why the additional `core.wait()` at the end. 
* Light on documentation. 
* **code**: 3.5/4, **documentation** 2/4

:memo: **Total:** 23/54
* I'm only going to grade it out of Qs 1 - 3 and 6. = 23/34
* I wonder if we should have a chat about getting you a little more up to speed
