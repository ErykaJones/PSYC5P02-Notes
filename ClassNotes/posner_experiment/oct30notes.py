#builder notes
# builder will show the amount of time it is set to display
#can also record key response 

#to see the python script, there is a button next to the run button that will write it in a python script
#it's heavy though because it needs to be for it to translate to javascript
#height is the percentage of the screen it takes up, pixels is generally not recommended because it's not transferable
#to make a condition list:
#columns show what we want to manipulate
#image column, orientation, different x plot, condition, correct answer 
#num repeats refers to repeating all your conditions, so if yyou have three conditions and 5 repeats, that would be 15 trials


#random will populate a list of n-1 of your conditions, so you will never see the same  condition twice in a row
#full random will allow that to happen

#if you want randomly orienting stimuli, you can set the orientation to every repeat
#when importing excel, you can input the heading name into something like object orientation so it knows where to read it 

#if you want it to read the text as a variable, use a $ (some spots will already have it)

#custom code will translate to java too
#code that needs to interact with stimuli should go under it because of how code is read one line at a time
