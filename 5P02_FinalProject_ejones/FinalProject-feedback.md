# PSYC 5P02- Introduction to Programming for Psychology

### Fall 2025
### Final Project Evaluation


#### Overall grade: 79%

---
#### Coding style/Clarity:
* Code runs clean and is readable
* I appreciate the effort to include functions but some potentially problematic passing of variables 
* Could use more global variables to control values rather than hard-coding
* Some inelegance in some of the Psychopy code
:memo: **check-** 

#### Coding efficiency:
* Functions being created where they are only being called once
:memo: **check**

#### Documentation:
* Decent documentation.  Could have included a description of the files and how to implement and run (e.g., a readme file). No help files.
:memo: **check-/check**

#### Complexity, scale of tasks/analysis, and mastery:
* Fairly limited in scope. Appear to still struggle with some key course concepts
 :memo: **check--**

#### Completeness:
* Could organize your files a bit better and have a sub-directory for your images
* Would be easier to access as a stand-alone repository. 
 :memo: **check**
